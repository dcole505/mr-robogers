## Description

_The purpose of this project is to solidify concepts of looping and modifying arrays. In addition, previous concepts drawn from past sections are utilized in order to meet the project requirements. This user will be prompted to enter a numerical value which will be manipulated in the form of an array. The business logic of the scripts.js file will handle parsing through the array and making necessary changes in order to output an appropriate message to the user._
